# Everything About React.js Hooks

## **01 : useReducer()**

The `useReducer()` hook is typically used for managing complex state logic in a React component. It's an alternative to `useState()` when the state logic is more complex or involves multiple sub-values. `useReducer()` allows you to manage state transitions through actions, making it easier to scale the state logic.

It is commonly used in situations where you need to handle more intricate logic (like counter apps, forms, or complex state management) or if you want to perform multiple actions on the state simultaneously.

It works similarly to Redux, using a "reducer" function to specify how the state should be updated based on dispatched actions. The main advantage of `useReducer()` is that it helps centralize and modularize state transitions, especially in more complex applications.

## **02 : useRef()**

The `useRef()` hook is primarily used to persist values across renders without causing a re-render. It is most commonly used for accessing and interacting with DOM elements, but it can also be used to keep track of mutable values that do not require rendering when updated.

When using `useRef()`, it returns a mutable `ref` object with a `.current` property, which can be used to store values or references to DOM elements. Unlike `useState()`, changes to the value stored in `useRef()` will not trigger a component re-render.

Common use cases include:

- Accessing and interacting with DOM elements directly.
- Storing previous values to compare between renders.
- Keeping track of values that do not need to trigger UI updates (e.g., timeouts, intervals).

## **03 : useId()**

The `useId()` hook was introduced in React 19 to generate unique IDs for elements in a component. It ensures that each component instance has a unique ID, which is especially useful when dealing with accessibility (ARIA) attributes, form elements, and other cases that require unique identifiers.

The hook guarantees that the generated ID is stable across renders and is consistent even when a component re-renders. This eliminates the need for manually managing unique IDs, which is common when working with dynamically generated components.

`useId()` is particularly useful when you have repeated components in your UI and need a reliable way to assign unique identifiers to ensure proper functionality and accessibility.
